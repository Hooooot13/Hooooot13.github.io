      <p> The one thing you need to know about me is that I love engineering. I love making things and fixing things. I love learning how things work and finding ways to make them better. I love engineering so much that I do it in my free time, and I am currently looking for a company that will let me do more of what I love for them. My particular interests are automation/robotics, aerospace systems, and green energy systems. Right now my primary goal is to gain more experience in one of those three fields. </p>

            <h2> IEEE Robotics Team </h2>
            <p class="Position"> <b> Team Leader </b> </p>
            <p class="Notes"> During my senior year of college, I was asked to lead our IEEE chaptersâ€™ robotics team. Every year, many schools across the country compete in a competition to create an automated machine to perform a series of ostensibly simple tasks. In the year that I was the leader, the competition objective was to stack as many Lego&trade; bricks as possible is a set about of time. We faced several design and production challenges but we eventually prevailed and we prepared to compete in the competition. During this project, I grew as both a person and an engineer. I learned a variety of technical skills more importantly, I learned valuable leadership and management skills, and I learned how to employ the engineering process to create a product from scratch.  </p>

            <p class="Position"> <b> Undergraduate Researcher </b> </p>
            <p class="Notes"> Working at the Center for Energy Systems Research (CESR) was an excellent experience. I worked with Dr. Charles Van-Nest on his capacitive wireless power transfer system. While I was there designed and built devices used to test the power transfer capabilities of that system. I designed and performed several experiments, and assisted in the execution of several more experiments. I gained valuable experience in the field of wireless power transfer and learned about the process of academic research. </p>

            <p class="Position"> <b> Undergraduate Assessor </b> </p>
            <p class="Notes"> The Industrial Assessment Center (IAC) is a not for profit consultation group affiliated with the United States Department of Energy (DOE). We perform free energy assessments for manufacturing facilities that help to make those facilities more efficient, saving them money, and making the world a cleaner place for everyone. Working with the IAC allowed me to explore in-depth the manufacturing process for everything from wood flooring to electromagnets. It was genuinely the most interesting job I have ever had. In my time there I learned about energy efficiency, waste management, process design, and manufacturing facilities management.  </p>

            <h2> American Cast Iron Piping Company </h2>
            <p class="Position"> <b> Full-Time Intern </b> </p>
            <p class="Notes"> American Cast Iron Piping Company (ACIPCo) makes if you can believe it, cast iron pipes. I interned there in the summer between my junior and senior years of college. While there I performed a wide variety of tasks, everything from process analysis to human interface programing. Most of what I spent my time on was tracking and fixing process delays in part of the facility. During my exit presentation, I estimated that I saved the company $250,000 in minor process changes.  </p>
