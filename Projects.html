              I think the best way to learn is to ask smart people dumb questions. Unfortunately, I don’t know any smart people so I have to make do with asking myself silly questions. This blog tackles questions of all magnitudes, anything from spiderman maximum jump height to the power loss caused by your phone case when you wirelessly charge it. <br> <br>
              Just so you know, I am not the first person to have this idea and if you like this and want to read something in a similar vein written by someone way smarter than me then,  please to check out Randle Monroes' "What if?"<br> <br>

    <h1> Woodworking </h1>
    <h3> 90% autoCAD, 5% building, 5% bandages </h3>
    <div class="flex-container">
      <div class="flex-child">
        <p> When we moved to Huntsville we left all of our furniture behind and decided to build everything we need ourselves. After that, I discovered that AutoCAD and woodworking are both fun. This is where I will post CAD files and downloadable PDFs with parts lists and cut lists in case you want to make something similar.
